This repository contains.

1)	The model itself, which can be opened with a program called “NetLogo”: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml
2)	A map of the political borders that I used for the paper. To use this map, simply put it in the same folder as the folder where you download the model (not NetLogo’s folder), and you can then also edit it with Paint to create the territory of a new country. The important thing to keep in mind is that the overall size of the map cannot be changed, and that we have to keep the colour scheme that I used (black for the territory of the state, and white for everything else). If there is no black at all, or if there is no white at all, the model may throw an error. The agents are then generated inside one of the valid locations, in the territory assigned to the state being made.
3)	A dataset (csv) that results from the experiments I ran with that particular model for that particular country. 
4)	A Jupyter Notebook (see this: https://jupyter.org/ ) used for data analysis and for generating the charts that are used in the paper. After the installation of Jupyter, simply copy the dataset (point 3 above) in the same folder as this notebook, then load the notebook, and then run all cells to produce the resulting graphs.
